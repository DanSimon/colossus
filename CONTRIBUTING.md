# Contributing

Because Colossus is pre 1.0 and under very heavy development, there is lots of
room for improvement and we are not afraid to make large-scale breaking changes
if it makes sense.  All bug fixes and feature improvements are welcome, but if
you are planning on implementing a significant change, especially one that
changes an API or breaks backwards compatibility, you should verify with one of
the core contributors that your work won't conflict with any ongoing or planned
changes.

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. If you've significantly changed low-level code, you must run benchmarks and provide numbers.
6. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").
